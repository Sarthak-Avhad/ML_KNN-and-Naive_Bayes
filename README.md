# 🤖 KNN & Naive Bayes – Machine Learning Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental **classification algorithms** in Machine Learning:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

The aim is to understand how these algorithms classify data, compare their performance, and evaluate model accuracy.
